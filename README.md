# Task List Web App

This is a simple Task List Web Application built with React. Users can add, edit, and delete tasks. The tasks are stored in the browser's `localStorage` to persist data across page reloads.

## Features

- **Add tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the list.
- **Edit tasks**: Users can click the "Edit" button to modify an existing task.
- **Delete tasks**: Users can click the "Delete" button to remove a task from the list.
- **Persistence**: The task list is stored in the browser's `localStorage`, so the tasks remain even after page reloads or browser restarts.
- **Responsive design**: The app is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the components.
- **localStorage**: To persist tasks data on the browser.
